# Overview

DevGate is our last Web Development project for this semester. Basically it is a lightweight social network designed to provide a simpler interface for browsing and managing your online activity.

## Features

- **Repository Browsing**: View file trees, commits, and contributors in a GitHub‑style UI.

- **Live Development**: Hot‑reload powered by Vite ensures instant updates as you code.

- **Media Uploads**: Integrated Cloudinary for image and asset hosting directly from your browser.

- **Data Storage & Auth**: Firebase integration for secure user authentication and Firestore database operations.

- **Charts & Analytics**: Visualize project metrics with Chart.js and Axios for HTTP requests.

## Technologies Used

- **Framework & Build**

  - Vue 3 (UI components and reactivity)

  - Vite (bundler and dev server)

- **Styling & Layout**

  - Bootstrap (responsive design and UI components)

- **State & Routing**

  - Vue Router (client‑side routing)

- **Media & Assets**

  - Cloudinary Vue SDK (`@cloudinary/vue`, `@cloudinary/url-gen`) for asset management

- **Data & Networking**

  - Firebase (authentication and Firestore)

  - Axios (HTTP client)

- **Visualization**

  - Chart.js (data visualization)

- **Utilities & Plugins**

  - Prettier (code formatting)

  - Vite Plugin Vue Devtools (`vite-plugin-vue-devtools`) for enhanced debugging
